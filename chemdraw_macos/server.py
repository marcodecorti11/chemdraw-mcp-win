    locally with recorded provenance, including offline. Other user-supplied names/CAS
    include PubChem lookup by default; do not ask for a separate confirmation.
    Only the supplied query is sent.
    For offline, no-network or confidential requests set allow_network=false.
    SMILES/InChI stay local. Ambiguous matches return needs_input.
    The enforced pipeline owns native rendering, house style,
    measured layout, graph checks and exports. No yield/product prediction.
    Auto and interactive reuse the active working document for supported flat
    molecules/captions, including untitled documents. Supply document_id to bind a
    specific active canvas. One final API insertion, no clipboard or keyboard movement.
    Tables use one hidden native measuring copy for exact visible-ink centering.
    OS foreground focus is not required after the connection is opened.
    page_policy=add_pages (default) adds identical physical sheets vertically inside
    the SAME document when needed, up to 20 pages; keep refuses overflow.
    No molecule shrinking or separate overflow document. New objects use house style;
    existing objects retain their style. A unique matching live parent supplies
    scaffold orientation automatically. A whole ring/linker scaffold extracted from
    a supplied input can anchor related structures when it matches every graph with chirality.
    panel=auto selects a plain aligned grid on the shared canvas, without a retry
    or inferred decorations. Missing labels on SMILES/InChI become numbers, not
    formulas. Exports contain the whole current canvas.
    Shared molecules default to exports=auto: editable canvas and CDXML recovery
    snapshot, without image export. Inspect in ChemDraw first. Request exports=preview
    explicitly for a white review image, or full for transparent PNG and SVG.
    For a requested new rounded/shadowed table use panel=framed, optional heading,
    and no document_id. One complete framed document, no follow-up decoration.
    Framed panels also default to canvas-only; full exports contain just the table.
    Publication/DPI exports use chemdraw_export_figure afterwards, without redrawing.
    Validated name/CAS results are cached in this process for five minutes;
    refresh_identifiers=true forces a new lookup. Permission/ambiguity rules remain.
    timings measures server work, not model reasoning or client-side image review.
    Reactions in auto/background assemble the complete reaction locally, select
    reaction_paper=auto at unchanged scale, then use one whole-reaction measuring
    document and one final export document. Unit formal charges are circled by
    default, with one additional whole-document measurement for their ink. Saved
    charge ownership and bond/label clearance must pass; never omit failed circles.
    Editable CDXML, physical-scale SVG,
    600-DPI transparent PNG and a white preview are returned. Background documents
    are closed; interactive opens an additional verified presentation copy of the
    output. No per-participant native imports or cleanup. An active untitled original
    can be preserved through the add-in read; do not save or close it to bypass checks.
    Shared reactions and decorated panels are not supported; never silently redirect
    an explicit same-document request. This requires the licensed desktop, not a
    display-free renderer; native window opening can briefly flash. Output_dir must
    not already exist: the tool creates it. On rejection inspect the returned reason;
    do not retry with changed chemistry or UI control.
    Only completed means required gates passed; visual review remains required.
    Never retry uncertain writes or substitute another renderer.
    Submit a requested table as ONE complete batch, not independent rows.
    On table_needs_space stop: never retry smaller batches, drop requested entries,
    or create a second document to bypass a same-document request.
