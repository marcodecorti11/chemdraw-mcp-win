# Guarded drawing entry point

The client supplies chemical intent. The server owns the drawing procedure.
Use `chemdraw_draw` for new molecules, related panels and explicit reactions.
There is no embedded language model and no natural-language parser on the server.

The default molecule path now uses the [desktop API](DESKTOP_ADDIN.md): one
preplanned insertion into the active canvas, including untitled drawings. It
validates native chemistry, coordinates, typography/strokes, object ink bounds,
page fit and exports. It does not run per-molecule native imports or cleanup.
Ordinary reactions use the [batch reaction path](REACTION_BATCH.md), with bounded
physical-paper selection and native measured layout. Advanced legacy workflows
retain their original contracts.

For clients that should not choose among low-level tools:

```sh
chemdraw-mcp-macos --profile drawing
```

This profile exposes drawing, diagnostics and physical export. The existing
`full` profile also exposes the harness and recommends it for new drawings.
`core` remains the direct native API. Existing client processes must restart
to load the new code and tool schema. No client configuration is changed silently.

## Request

```json
{
  "molecules": [
    {"value": "C[C@H](O)C(=O)O", "format": "smiles", "label": "Explicit stereoisomer"}
  ]
}
```

Call `chemdraw_draw(request=..., output_dir="/absolute/new-folder")` or save the
request as JSON and use the same implementation through the CLI:

```sh
chemdraw-mac produce --request /absolute/request.json --output /absolute/new-folder
```

Each molecule needs `value` and `format` (`name`, `cas`, `smiles` or `inchi`).
Labels are optional; explicit graph inputs without labels display compact compound
numbers, not formulas or guessed names. Explicit labels are retained as text.
Reviewed bundled name references resolve locally before any provider request.
Currently `caffeine` and `caffein` (case-insensitive exact aliases) use the pinned
caffeine graph already used in the native setup test. The plan records its source
record, review date, identity validation and `network_used=false`. This also works
offline. Salts, derivatives and partial/fuzzy names are not matched to this record.
An explicit different `selected_cid` is never overridden. Set
`refresh_identifiers=true` to require a fresh provider lookup instead.
MCP `chemdraw_draw` defaults to `allow_network=true`: asking to draw a supplied
name/CAS includes its PubChem lookup, without a separate confirmation turn.
Only the supplied query is sent, not document contents. Explicit offline,
no-network or confidential requests must use `allow_network=false`.
SMILES/InChI drawing stays local. The CLI retains its explicit `--allow-network`
flag, and the standalone resolver retains its opt-in default.
A sole locally validated match is recorded as the selected source; ambiguous or
truncated results require an explicit `selected_cid` or a more specific input.
PubChem matching is not authoritative CAS Registry validation. Unspecified stereo
is retained as unspecified, not invented.

Add `products` in the same format for a reaction. All products must be supplied;
conditions may be placed in `conditions_above` and `conditions_below`.
Products, yields, activity and reaction balance are not predicted.

## Drawing speed and export choices

Shared molecule requests accept `exports`:

| Value | Delivered files |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) or `canvas` | Editable drawing and CDXML recovery snapshot, without image export |
| `preview` | Editable CDXML, native SVG and a white-background 1200-pixel `artifacts.preview` PNG for requested visual review |
| `full` | Editable CDXML, native SVG and the previous transparent 3200-pixel `artifacts.png` bundle |

The preview is not a publication export and is not advertised as a transparent
PNG. Do not convert it again just to inspect it on white. Use
`chemdraw_export_figure` or CLI `export-figure` afterwards for physical-scale
SVG/PNG and optional PDF, without redrawing. Chemistry, stereo, source preservation,
style, page fit and table alignment checks remain mandatory in every mode.
Canvas mode does not claim that an SVG export or image review occurred.
Reaction full exports use physical SVG and 600-DPI PNG, plus a white review image.
Other background workflows keep full exports; explicit `preview` and `canvas`
requests on legacy paths are rejected before native changes. The advanced
`chemdraw_draw_structures` interface also defaults to canvas-only for shared
drawings and interactive framed tables.

For a new complete table, set `panel="framed"` and optionally `heading`.
This route draws all supplied molecules inside a rounded, shadowed box in one
new document. It also defaults to canvas-only; `exports="full"` explicitly adds
physical SVG, a 600-DPI transparent PNG and a white review preview. The export
contains only the table, not the old parent and empty space on another sheet.
Do not combine this route with `document_id` or shared presentation. It does
not implement same-document decoration and never silently substitutes a copy.
Interactive delivery now keeps this new working document visible throughout
measurement and finishing. It does not open a second final drawing or use the
clipboard. This owned-document replacement is not an arbitrary replacement
operation on a user's pre-existing canvas.

Repeated name/CAS lookups reuse locally validated results for up to five minutes
in the same process. The cache has at most 128 entries, never writes queries to
disk, retains retrieval provenance and never removes ambiguity or truncation.
Set `refresh_identifiers: true` to bypass it and bundled references.
`allow_network=false` blocks provider resolution, including its cache hits;
bundled references do not require network permission. Separate CLI invocations do
not share memory; repeated inputs within one request can benefit.

Results include `timings.total_seconds` and `timings.stages_seconds` for input
resolution/planning, native reads, layout, insertion/verification and requested
exports. Timings exclude model reasoning, tool selection and client image review.
Native stage timings are retained in the audit; the overall timing is in
`result.json`. These measurements are evidence, not an estimated progress bar.

## Enforced gates

1. Strict typed request; unknown fields and attempts to skip checks are rejected.
2. Identifier resolution with provenance, local graph validation and support checks.
3. Native-readiness check, including preservation of existing user documents.
4. House-scale native drawing, measured layout and bounded document ownership.
5. Native saved-graph, layout and source-preservation checks.
6. Independent comparison of delivered graphs, conservative measured collision
   screening and requested artifacts. Shared `canvas` delivery omits images, not
   the graph/layout checks; background delivery retains CDXML/SVG/PNG requirements.
7. Structured result with artifact paths, plan, audit location and presentation state.

Related panels of at least four molecules use a common core only when an entire
ring-containing molecule supplied in the request matches every structure with
stereochemistry respected. This is not unrestricted scaffold inference. New
coordinate seeds are constrained to the native reference; existing drawings are
not reflected to force a fit. Exact supported substituent motifs produce group
bands, headings, dotted dividers and a native rounded shadow frame. Electronic
group labels describe motifs, not measured electronic properties or reactivity.
Unrecognized substitutions remain explicitly in `Other substitutions`.
This decoration policy applies to the separate background workflow. On the shared
canvas, `panel="auto"` selects a plain aligned grid before native execution while
retaining the common core. No initial rejection or retry with `plain` is needed.
Explicit decorations supplied through the advanced drawing tool remain unsupported
in shared mode; they are not silently removed. For a requested new framed table,
send all records and ordered `groups` to `chemdraw_draw_structures` with
`presentation="interactive"`, `frame=true` and no existing `document_id`.
Plain-charge grouped tables use one measuring copy and one complete final copy,
not a per-molecule workflow followed by a separate decoration call. The output
includes editable CDXML, physical-scale SVG, 600-DPI transparent PNG, a white
preview and timings. `pixels` remains a legacy option on this path; the physical
PNG scale is set by 600 DPI, not by fitting every figure to the same pixel box.

The basic shared path also preserves supported linked name-caption metadata.
A stale name does not replace the live atom/bond graph, and its metadata is
checked unchanged rather than requiring the user to delete the caption.
Other unsupported object types still fail before insertion.

If a native call becomes uncertain, the response includes available retained
artifacts, the last known working document ID and the audit location. These are
recovery evidence, not a successful completion. Do not redraw, import, decorate
again, switch to mouse control or start another CLI connection. Inspect the
reported document and audit read-only. A missing document ID means the native
response did not establish one, not permission to create a replacement.

In both auto and plain shared batches, a unique matching live molecular graph
supplies orientation. If replacing its substituent prevents a whole-parent match,
the planner tries the same conservative whole-supplied-ring-core rule and anchors
that core to the unique matching live drawing. If no live reference matches, a
verified supplied core aligns the batch to its first requested structure. This
also considers whole ring/linker frameworks derived from supplied graphs, only
when the entire framework matches every requested molecule. It does not infer a
maximum common substructure or chemical correspondence outside
the matched core. Requests without a verified core retain independent depictions;
use the advanced `scaffold_smiles` option for an explicit common core.

Fresh coordinate seeds with a regular six-membered ring use the smallest proper
rotation that makes a ring edge vertical. This removes arbitrary global tilt,
including the caffeine fused-ring example. It does not change relative atom
positions, bond length, stereochemistry or label orientation. Irregular rings,
chair/cage depictions and molecules without a qualifying ring keep their seed
orientation. A live reference always takes precedence; it is never straightened
behind the user's back. The planning report records each orientation policy and
rotation. This is a bounded depiction convention, not universal layout repair.

Columns are selected from measured widths. Failed alignment is not silently
dropped; overflow is not hidden by shrinking molecules independently. This
shared path can add identical vertical physical pages in the same document, up
to 20 pages, when the complete table needs more space. Set `page_policy="keep"`
to require the current page extent. Unsupported layouts fail without retry loops.

## Result states

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `completed` | Mandatory gates passed; final artifact paths are usable. |
| `needs_input` | Specific ambiguity, missing network permission or unsaved-document requirement. No production write dispatched. |
| `rejected` | A schema, support, layout or delivery gate failed. No renderer fallback. |
| `uncertain` | A dispatched native operation has uncertain state. No automatic retry or close. |

`completed` is not a universal chemical or pixel-perfect appearance certificate.
Native measured bounds and conservative bond envelopes can flag intentional
crossings; unsupported cases stop for inspection. Human visual review remains
explicitly required. The server cannot make an incorrect caller-supplied SMILES
correct merely by rendering it accurately.

`presentation="auto"` and `interactive` use the active canvas for molecules,
creating one working document only if none exists. `shared` with `document_id`
binds an explicit active document. Multi-molecule tables use one hidden native
measuring copy, closed after successful measurement; no second final document
is created for overflow.
Explicit `background` retains separate exports. Reactions use two hidden
whole-document stages; legacy molecule exports still use temporary imports.
All modes require a licensed logged-in desktop, not a display-free engine.

The chosen shared document may be untitled: the desktop API reads it without
assigning a filename, and checked insertion leaves it unsaved and open. Shared
reads and writes do not select all objects or use the clipboard. The batch
reaction path uses the same read-only add-in snapshot to preserve an active
untitled original. It needs the add-in connection for that read; it never saves
or closes the original as a workaround. Other legacy separate workflows retain
their existing untitled-document limits.

## Current acceptance scope

The batch planner also aligns acyclic analogue panels when a complete supplied
parent of 6 through 150 heavy atoms matches every input with stereochemistry
respected. It uses constrained parent coordinates without changing molecular
graphs or assigning new stereocentres. This depiction rule does not invent
scope categories or infer a partial common substructure. Explicit scaffold
requests and a unique matching live reference take precedence.
Fresh regular acyclic seeds with at least six heavy atoms are straightened onto
the 30/90-degree bond grid using only a rigid rotation. This removes inherited
global tilt for eligible seeds; input ordering can still affect orientation when
the first analogue has an irregular bond grid. It does not straighten an existing
live reference or change bond lengths, conformations or stereochemistry.

Portable tests exercise typed routing, chemistry breadth, strict rejection,
ambiguity, missing verification, collisions, presentation and uncertainty.
Native end-to-end tests are in `tests/test_harness_native.py`, using a mixed
chemistry panel, an automatically grouped unrelated scaffold family and an
explicit reaction through the reduced MCP profile. On 2026-09-15 all three
positive cases passed in 52.37 seconds on the development Mac. The untitled-document
guard was skipped because there was no untitled document; it passed separately
before the user saved the document. Each successful background job closed its own
documents and preserved the baseline inventory. Native PNGs were inspected on white.
The portable confirmation passed 961 tests with 70 native skips in 8.20 seconds.
These are bounded acceptance results, not a stable-release or cross-machine claim.
It does not support every
possible molecule: metals, exotic bond types and polymer semantics still use
separate bounded interfaces or are rejected.

Visual inspection also identifies the next layout-policy work: automatic columns
currently maximize width, so five unrelated molecules can occupy a sparse four-plus-one
grid. Group bands can likewise leave substantial unused space. Collision-free is
not equivalent to compact or well-balanced; bounded layout candidate selection
and broader native corpus coverage remain pending.
